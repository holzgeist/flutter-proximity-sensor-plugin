# proximity_sensor_example

Demonstrates how to use the proximity_sensor plugin.

## Getting Started

In the `pubspec.yaml` of your flutter project, add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  ...
  proximity_sensor:
```

In your library add the following import:

```dart
import 'package:proximity_sensor/proximity_sensor.dart';
```

## Note

Android 12 and higher are required to specify an explicit value for `android:exported`  
This is an example.

    <activity
        android:exported="true"
        ....

Regarding permissions, you may need the following settings in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

    <uses-permission android:name="android.hardware.sensor.proximity"/>

**Some recent devices use virtual proximity sensors. There are no physical sensors. I found it hard to trust the sensor information in this case.**
